# Clementine.js Angular Boilerplate

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/johnstonbl01/clementinejs](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/johnstonbl01/clementinejs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Overview

Clementine.js is a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js. Clementine.js errs on the side of transparency and simplicity as an alternative to more complex boilerplates.

The Angular boilerplate is a slightly modified version of the standard boilerplate which integrates Angular functionality.

## Versions

- [**Standard**](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs): the simplest version of Clementine.js. Intended for those who wish for the smallest and least intrusive footprint OR to implement features on their own.
- **Angular** (this version): a slightly more complex version of the same application. This version employs the use of AngularJS as the front-end framework.
- [**Free Code Camp (FCC)**](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-fcc): A modified version of the standard boilerplate that is intended for use with the [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/) curriculum.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

In order to use Clementine.js, you must have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) (optional)

### Installation & Startup

There are 2 ways to install Clementine.js:

- Clone the GitHub Repository
- Install via Yeoman Generator

Both options are similar, and a matter of preference.

**Option 1 - Clone GitHub Repo**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-angular.git your-project
```

This will install the Clementine.js components into the `your-project` directory.

**Option 2 - Yeoman Generator**

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-clementinejs
$ mkdir your-project
$ cd your-project
$ yo clementinejs:angular
```

Note: `generator-clementinejs` must be installed globally.

To start the application, browse to the project directory and type: `$ node server` into the terminal window. Point a browser to `localhost:3000` and you're up and running!
